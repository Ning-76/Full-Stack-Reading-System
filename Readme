System Demonstration:

1. User Interface (UI):
Display a list of books. Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for the book list to enhance user experience.
Briefly demonstrate the review feature.
Showcase the search functionality to find specific books.
Highlight the review functionality:
Allow users to create new book reviews by providing necessary details such as book title, author, review text, and rating.
Support editing of existing book reviews.
Enable deletion of book reviews.
Implement sorting options for the review list.
Provide a search bar or filter button to search for reviews by specific keywords or attributes.

2. Front-end and Back-end Testing:
Show the integration between the front-end and back-end.
Perform operations like adding and editing reviews, which will be reflected both on the page and in the MongoDB database.
Validate the synchronization between the front-end and back-end systems.

3. Backend API:
Implement endpoints for retrieving a list of book reviews.
Implement endpoints for creating new book reviews.
Implement endpoints for updating existing book reviews.
Implement endpoints for deleting book reviews.
Include server-side filtering and sorting options for efficient data processing.
Integrate with a data storage solution like MongoDB to persist review data.
Now that we've covered the system demonstration and the backend and frontend testing, let's dive into the technology used and discuss the various components of the system.
